          In envisioning a thriving and resilient future for the Upper Clutha
          Catchment, our holistic catchment health framework embraces the
          profound interconnection of people and place, recognising the
          intrinsic value of Te Taiao. Grounded in community leadership and
          collaboration, we are committed to fostering a collective sense of
          responsibility for the well-being of our environment. Our vision
          extends beyond scientific data; it encompasses the lived experiences,
          cultures, and aspirations of the communities within our catchment.

          This framework serves as a compass, guiding environmental restoration
          activities and investment with a keen understanding of the delicate

          wisdom of local communities and the expertise of diverse
          organisations, we strive for a sustainable and harmonious coexistence
          between nature and society for present and future generations to come.
